# Inkwell(s)

**I**t's a **N**ew **K**ind of **W**rapper for **E**xposing **LL**VM (*S*afely)

Inkwell aims to help you pen your own programming languages by safely wrapping llvm-sys. It provides a more strongly typed interface than LLVM itself so that certain types of errors can be caught at compile time instead of at LLVM's runtime. The ultimate goal is to make LLVM a bit safer and easier to use.
